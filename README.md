# Car_Rental_Company

Car Rental Company:

This is a simple program that models the basic functionality of a car rental company. Different types of rental cars can be provided to eligible customers, and the program keeps track of which cars are currently being rented 

and their customers' details, as well as simulating 'car journeys' and the associated fuel requirements/usage. 

Files ending in "Test.java" are unit tests created in JUnit allowing classes to be tested with some inputted data, as this program does not currently have database connectivity. 

The program makes use of a few different design patterns.
